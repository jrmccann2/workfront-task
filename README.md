# Workfront Task

I was tasked with creating a countdown app. The instructions asked for a demonstration
of my skills with `Javascript`, `HTML`, and `CSS` so I decided to keep it strictly to those
tools and not use any outside libraries or frameworks. I used a reset CSS to eliminate
default browser styles. I then just did some simple styling and used `media queries` to 
create a simple responsive design. Feel free to clone it and look at my code.
